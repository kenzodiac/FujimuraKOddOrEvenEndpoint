Program Description: This is a program that emulates the console project of the same name that we did during the coding combine. It's an API program that takes in a single interger number input fron the user, and reports to the user whether that number is an odd or even number.

Peer Review By: Reed Goodwin -- Codes works well and and fucntions properly, I like the way the UI works and he did a good job with the validation. I like how compact and neat the code is!

How To Instuctions:
1) Load the program into VSCode.
2) Start Debugging.
3) Copy Local Host URL from the console (e.g. "http://localhost:5264")
4) Open Postman program and paste the copied URL into a new workspace, with the "GET" input field.
5) Append the URL with "OddOrEvenEndpoint/OddOrEven/{num}"
6) Replace "{num}" with any whole interger that the user decides upon, and hit the "Send" button to the right of the input field.
